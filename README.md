# UFO Analysis

## Overview of UFO Analysis
Dana is a data journalist from McMinnville, Oregon who is interested in UFO sightings. She has a JavaScript file filled with UFO sighting information. The file has information on countries, cities, states, and types of sightings. She wants to use Javascript to display the data as a table. The data set is large, so Dana wants to add filters for ease of use. Dana hopes to post her article online, so she wants to put everything together in a tidy HTML page. I was able to help Dana complete her article on UFO sightings using Savascript and HTML pages. 


## Results
I first used Javascript to display the data as a table and add filters for ease of use. Dana wanted everything displayed in a tidy HTML page and created a Storyboard to show me how she wanted the webpage to look. I created the HTML page based off the Storyboard below:

To make Dana's online article more visually appealing, I added a photo and color to make the page pop. Please see the end results of the navigation bar, page header, article title, and article paragraph.

Next, I displayed the UFO sighting information as a data to the right. I added a date, city, state, country, and shape filter on the left. The filters allow for ease of use. There is a button to filter and button to clear the filters once you are done. Please see the end results of the data table and filters.

## Summary
The UFO Sighting HTML page displays the UFO sighting information in a useful and visually appealing way. However, one drawback of this website and data is that people who do not know anything about UFOs may not know what to search or how to filter the data. Here are two recommendations for further development that may enchance the website:

1. We could add filters to the table column names so people will be able to filter by column to explore the data. People may not know much but after exploring the inital data, they may be able to find things they would like to search for. 
2. To enhance the website's aggregation of information, we could o some outside search and find news articles that could be linked in the website for people who would like to read more about a UFO siting.

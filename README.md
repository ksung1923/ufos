# UFO Analysis

## Overview of UFO Analysis
Dana is a data journalist from McMinnville, Oregon who is interested in UFO sightings. She has a JavaScript file filled with UFO sighting information. The file has information on countries, cities, states, and types of sightings. She wants to use Javascript to display the data as a table. The data set is large, so Dana wants to add filters for ease of use. Dana hopes to post her article online, so she wnats to put everything together in a tidy HTML page. I was able to help Dana completely her article on UFO sightings using Savascript and HTML pages.
